The engine called "Empresa" isÂ allowing Miva Merchant to run on a server.   
Empresa will be able to execute any compiled Miva Script file with a .mvc extension once it is installed.   
Miva Merchant's core platform is divided into two distinct parts.   
One of these is its template language, which is known as "Store Morph Technology" or "SMT" for short.   
This template language is allows you to complete design flexibility of any page of your store. It also gives you the power to do conditionals, create variables and lot of powerful programming features like file read write.  
Miva Merchant itself is made up of a bunch of Miva Modules.   
A module is a Miva Script file that gets compiled, gets run through the compiler and gets converted to a .mvc file, which is a compiled Miva Script.  
We can also create custom modules in Miva Merchant.
